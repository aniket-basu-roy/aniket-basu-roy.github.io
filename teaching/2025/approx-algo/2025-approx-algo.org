* Introduction

#+begin_quote
/An old engineering slogan says, “Fast. Cheap. Reliable. Choose two.” Similarly, if P $\neq$ NP, we can’t simultaneously have algorithms that (1) ﬁnd optimal solutions (2) in polynomial time (3) for any instance. At least one of these requirements must be relaxed in any approach to dealing with an NP-hard optimization problem./ [[*References][1]]
#+end_quote

Approximation algorithms ensure that conditions /(2)/ and /(3)/ are satisfied while relaxing condition /(1)/.

** Learning Objectives
At the end of the course, students are expected to
1. Be familiar with the basic paradigms of approximation algorithms.
2. Design and analyze algorithms and lower bounds for optimization problems covered in the course. This includes the ability to /formally express/ the proof of approximation factors and running times of the algorithms.
3. Given an optimization problem, apply the tools and techniques covered in the course.

* Evaluation and Grading Policy

| End term    | 35% |   
| Mid term    | 30% |   
| Assignments | 15% |   
| Seminar     | 15% |   
| Scribe      | 05% |   

** Seminar
Every student is required to present a research paper from a given list of papers, which will be posted a month before the seminar.
The seminar will be scheduled for the week 14-18/04, depending on the number of students crediting the course.

** Scribe
Every lecture will be scribed by 1-2 students on a round-robin basis. The scribe should be LaTeXed and submitted within 7 days from the end of the lecture.
