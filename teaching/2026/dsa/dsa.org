* Introduction
#+begin_quote
"THE PROCESS of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music."

--- The Art of Computer Programming, Donald E. Knuth

- Homework (non-evaluative):
  1. Draw a flowchart (directed graph) for Bubblesort
  2. Prove its correctness
  3. Find its worst-case time complexity as a function of the size of the array
